# 100DaysOfCode with PyJaipur

**100 Days of Code is a challenge/community, where you publicly commit to code for 1 hour for the next 100 days.**

## Rules:
* Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
* Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.( if not twitting daily you need to mention progress in this repo.)

## Benefits:
* Coding will become a daily habit for you.
* Every day that you consistently code, you’ll build momentum. That momentum will make it easier for you to learn more advanced topics.
* The projects that you’ll build will be small in scope, so by the time you finish, you’ll have completed several of them — and gained a wide range of experience.
* Your GitHub profile will look extremely active. And yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these.
* You’ll greatly diminish your fear of starting a new coding project. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.
* You’ll have a good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day.
