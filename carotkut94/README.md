# Death Code

## Introduction
I am Sidhant Rajora aka DeathCode. Professionally I am a Java guy or to be more precise I make mobile applications. I choose python as weapon when it comes to problem solving
as python is way more elegant, looks more beautiful and simple as 2+2.
I write blog on medium, and publish videos on youtube.

# Day 1
On day one I am going for standard foo-bar type of problem statement and this problem is from Project Euler.

### Problem Statement
`If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.`

# Day 2
On Day two I choose a simple problem that is taken from leetcode.

### Problem Statement
`Given a non empty array of integers, every element is repeated twice except for one, find that single unique number`

This problem can be found at https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number


# Day 3
On day three I choose the problem of finding the sum of even fibonacci numbers upto 4 Million taken from project euler.

### Problem Statement
`Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... 
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.`
