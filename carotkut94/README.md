# Death Code

## Introduction
I am Sidhant Rajora aka DeathCode. Professionally I am a Java guy or to be more precise I make mobile applications. I choose python as weapon when it comes to problem solving
as python is way more elegant, looks more beautiful and simple as 2+2.
I write blog on medium, and publish videos on youtube.

# Day 1
On day one I am going for standard foo-bar type of problem statement and this problem is from Project Euler.

### Problem Statement
`If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.`

On Day two I choose a simple problem that is taken from leetcode.

### Problem Statement
