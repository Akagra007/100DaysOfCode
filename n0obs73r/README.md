# Aryan Dadheech
Hoi, I'm Aryan Dadheech. Currently pursuing Btech from JECRC University,Jaipur.

I've done some projects on IOT. I was into AI and Machine learning but after knowing the requirements just to get started with it were a nightmare for me. So for now, I've backed-up and been searching and scratching the surfaces different fields just to get the taste of everything. Yeah, I'm an explorer too :v . You can call me a noob, Well that's what my username say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but i do have a passion for learning new stuff.

As a fresher i don't have a working experience, but i do have the will to learn. 
In this upcoming time, taking #100DaysofCode as a challenge i'd be learning about android develpoment and language C++. And I've rolled into a Machine learning course as well just to have an idea about how things work around in advance alogs :')
