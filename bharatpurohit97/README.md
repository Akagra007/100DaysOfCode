Bharat Purohit Here,

Pursuing Graduate studies in Converging Technologies, leading to a career in Research.
i get more interest in automating stuffs. my interest lies in Neural networks, Datascience and converging aspect of Neuro & Cognitive Science in Computer Science.


- ### University - Centre For Converging Technologies, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur

- ### Dual Degree B.Tech + M.tech - Pre-Final Year  

# Day 1
 I am working on a project in Bioinformatics, Some kind of simualation for DNA.
 
 today i implemented multiprocessing for [Biosensor-Python](https://github.com/DBT-BIF/Biosensor-Python) class. 
 
 The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a machine.
 
 i will make it online after running programme locally to all `Genomes` (approx) ~18,00,000. i will be more happy if anyone wants to learn more about project.
