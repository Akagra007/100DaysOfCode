# Who am I?
Halo! I am Tanay Mehta, a freshman studying in JECRC University. I have a strong passion for Deep Learning, Statistical Modelling, Reinforcement Learning and Computational Neuroscience. I am also 'good-enough' at MEAN Stack, Little-bit of Back-end Web Development and some Basic Web Development here and there. My plans for upcoming 100 days is to work slowly but surely on a Mathematics and Statistical Modelling Library that I am going to build in Python from scratch (P.S: My interpretation of Scratch means NO EXTERNAL LIBRARY, not even numpy).
So, let's hope, I can finish this Library (or atleast, some substantial part of it!) before 100 Days End!
Happy Hacking!
